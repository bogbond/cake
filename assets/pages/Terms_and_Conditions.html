      <h2>1. Cakes and Products</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1.1 It’s a Cheeky Cake (hereinafter referred to as "It’s a Cheeky Cake" or "me", "I", "my") will use the best ingredients it can source.</li>
        <li>1.2 I do not cater to severe allergies of any kind. I do not provide "free from" products (e.g., gluten-free, dairy-free, egg-free). My kitchen and equipment may have traces of allergens, including nuts, dairy, and gluten. I cannot guarantee my products are free from any allergens.</li>
        <li>1.3 For orders under £100, £20 non-refundable payment is required to secure your booking. For orders over £100, a 50% non-refundable deposit is required, with the balance due 2 weeks before the date of collection/delivery. Failure to make payment by the due date may result in the date being released and all obligations by me ceasing.</li>
        <li>1.4 Orders will only be confirmed upon payment of the agreed deposit or full payment, whichever I request.</li>
        <li>1.5 If the event is cancelled, and you wish to cancel your order, all deposits remain non-refundable. Cancellation must be made in writing.</li>
        <li>1.6 If a request to reschedule is made, I will do my best to accommodate you. If the date cannot be rescheduled, or the request is made less than 1 week before the event, clause 1.5 will apply.</li>
        <li>1.7 All orders are bespoke and made to your exact requirements; therefore, each quote will be individual and relate specifically to that order.</li>
        <li>1.8 Once products are collected or delivered, they become the customer’s responsibility. I will not be liable for any damage occurring thereafter.</li>
        <li>1.9 You are solely responsible for the safe transportation of your completed cakes. I advise that cakes should be transported flat in the boot of your car or footwell with some non-slip matting underneath your cake box. I will supply you with a cake box for transportation. I will not be liable for any damage occurring after handover of the items. It is advised that you drive safely and avoid sharp braking, sudden acceleration, and tight fast corners. Avoid speed bumps where possible, and if necessary, take them slowly.</li>
        <li>1.10 It is your responsibility to read through any quote carefully. Any requests to amend flavour or design must be made in writing not less than 2 weeks before the event. I will do my best to accommodate changes, but this may not be possible. Changes may incur extra charges, payable immediately, and any work commenced for the original specification will also require a charge.</li>
        <li>1.11 Deliveries are charged per mile plus time taken for the return trip and any setup required at an hourly rate.</li>
        <li>1.12 Storage of items should be away from direct sunlight and heat sources. It is necessary to store in a fridge unless specifically instructed. Items are best consumed within 3 days of collection/delivery.</li>
        <li>1.13 If the complaint concerns the product purchased, this must be notified within 24 hours, a photo must be immediately provided and the product returned to me.</li>
        <li>1.14 Once received, I will investigate the nature of the complaint, and any decision made will be final.</li>
        <li>1.15 If a mistake has been made, I will offer a refund either in part or full, depending upon the severity, at my discretion.</li>
        <li>1.16 It is your responsibility to ensure all non-edible decoration is removed from the product prior to cutting and consumption (for example, dowels, ribbons, wired flowers).</li>
      </ul>
